# Ory Kratos ReactJS / NextJS User Interface Reference Implementation

This repository contains a reference implementation for Ory Kratos' in ReactJS /
NextJS. It implements all Ory Kratos flows (login, registration, account
settings, account recovery, account verification).

If you only want to add authentication to your app, and not customize the login,
registration, account recovery, ... screens, please check out the
[Ory Kratos Quickstart](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/quickstart).

To learn more about using this app, how it is built, and how to customize it
head over to the
[accompanying blog post](https://www.ory.sh/nextjs-authentication-spa-custom-flows-open-source)
which will be released soon!

The app itself you can see live at
**[kratos-reference-ui-react-nextjs.vercel.app](https://kratos-reference-ui-react-nextjs.vercel.app)**.
